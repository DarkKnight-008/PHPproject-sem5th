iNotes - PHP CRUD Application
Overview
iNotes is a simple PHP-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing notes. It provides a user-friendly web interface to add, edit, delete, and view notes stored in a MySQL database. The application uses secure prepared statements for database operations to prevent SQL injection and includes client-side pagination and search using DataTables.

1.Features:
-Add new notes with title and description.
-View notes in a paginated, searchable table.
-Edit existing notes via a modal form.
-Delete notes with confirmation.
-Responsive UI built with Bootstrap 5.
-Secure database operations using MySQLi prepared statements.
-Clean separation of PHP backend logic and frontend HTML/JS.
-Support for user-friendly error and success messages.

2.Technology Used:
-PHP 7.x or higher
-MySQL / MariaDB
-Bootstrap 5 CSS framework
-jQuery and DataTables plugin for table interactivity
-Apache or compatible web server

3.Setup Instructions:
(1)Create a MySQL database named inotes (or modify the config as needed).
(2)Run the following SQL to create the notes table:

sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
    sno INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    `note title` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `note description` TEXT,
    `timestamp` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
(3)Configure database connection in db.php.
(4)Place the project files in your web server directory.
(5)Access index.php in your browser.
(6)Use the interface to add, edit, and delete notes.

4.Security Considerations
-All database queries use prepared statements to protect against SQL injection.
-User input is sanitized and output is escaped.
-The app does not currently implement user authentication; consider adding it for a multi-user environment.
-File uploads (if integrated) should include validations for type, size, and storage location.

5.Troubleshooting
-If edits or deletes fail on paginated pages, ensure the correct jQuery delegated event handlers are used (see provided JS code).
-If upload or script validation fails, check hosting environment for restrictions and use modular, minimal scripts.
-Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript or network issues.

6.Extending the Project
-Add user authentication and authorization.
-Integrate file attachments with notes.
-Implement advanced search and filtering.
-Provide export/import functionality.
